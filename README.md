# LearnAndTestDocker

1- Follow https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/ install Docker on Windows. 

2- Follow step in [Learn Docker in 12 Minutes üê≥](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFl2mCHdv24) 

3- Got Error: [no matching manifest for windows/amd64 in the manifest list entries](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48066994/docker-no-matching-manifest-for-windows-amd64-in-the-manifest-list-entries) 

I guess it's because many package only support docker on linux, but not support docker on windows, so I want to make a linux OS with docker.

4- Turn to test on Linux Docker, first [Install CentOS](http://blog.itist.tw/2014/07/centos7-prepare.html)

5- Then I first try [Docker Official Tutorial: Get Docker CE for CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/) <br/> 
, but in the step `sudo yum install docker-ce`, I got error `No package docker-ce available. `.

6- I find another [CentOS install Docker tutorial : 
001-Âú® Cent OS 7 ‰∏äÂÆâË£Ö docker-ce]() works, and install Docker successfully
